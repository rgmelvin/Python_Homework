# Python_Homework
My python homework for FinTech BootCamp lives here

Python homework:

I did the required part off of the top my head at first. 
Comments are experiential to try to communicate what I was 
thinking. It was a lot of in situ learning.


I then did the optional exercise later following on 
what I learned from the required exercise and a lot
of independent learning. I tried to structure it
better and make it quite clean.

I then re-worked the PyBank exercise to be a clean set of instructions.
I am happy with what I have learned but I don't feel that I started out
with enough instruction to be able to do the work properly.
