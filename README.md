# Python_Homework
My python homework for FinTech BootCamp lives here

Python homework:

I did the required part off of the top my head. 
Comments are experiential to try to communicate what I was 
thinking. It was a lot of in situ learning.
I did the optional exercise later following on 
what I learned from the required exercise and a lot
of independent learning. I tried to structure it
better and make it quite clean.
I am working on a clean copy of the required PyBank
assignment but I want to leave the messier version
intact as a journal of thinking through things.
